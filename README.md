Implementation of the mathematical object Shifted Primed Tableaux, together with a crystal structure, in Sage.

Background and the description of crystal operators can be found in [our FPSAC paper](FPSAC_paper.pdf), file [shifted_primed_tableaux.py](shifted_primed_tableaux.py) has the implementation code that has been integrated into Sage.
